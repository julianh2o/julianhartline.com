Reflowster is a self-contained controller that uses a standard toaster oven to perform accurate reflow soldering.

Our team of two has been working on turning Reflowster from a breadboard hack into a finished product.
After a few months of work, we're ready to launch our Kickstarter in early April. From there, the fate of Reflowster lies in the hands
of our backers.
