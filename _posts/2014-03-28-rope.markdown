Click anywhere on the rope to drag it. Press the space bar to toggle<br>
fixed end mode (the other end stays in one place or moves around). Use the left and right<br>
arrow keys to navigate the menu and use the up and down arrows to change the variables.<br>

<h3>Things to try:</h3><h4>Standing wave:</h4>Grab the middle of the rope fairly close to a fixed end, stretch it out, and move your mouse up and<br>
down until the wave looks like it is staying in one place. First try to get the middle<br>
of the rope to oscillate like a jump rope, then try to get multiple peaks with nodes inbetween<br>
that stay in one place.<br>
<h4>Wave reflection:</h4><br>
In fixed end mode (works best without gravity): Position the rope so that it makes pretty close<br>
to horizontal line across the area. Grab one end and make a wave by quickly jerking the end up<br>
and then down. The wave will continue across the rope and be reflected at the other end.<br>
(This works best if you change the damping to about .80)<br>
In loose end mode (you need gravity for this one): Let the rope fall while holding on to the<br>
fixed end. Like in fixed end mode, send a wave down the rope by dragging it out to the side and<br>
back. (This works best with damping as above and a reduced gravity.)<br>
<h4>Constructive Interference:</h4><br>
Setting up as above in fixed end mode, create a wave on one end and quickly create another on<br>
the other end. Where they meet in the middle, a larger wave will be formed momentarily. This also<br>
works if you grab the rope in the middle and make a wave going in both directions letting go as they<br>
come back to the center. (Works best with increased mass as it slows down the rope's reaction)<br>
<h4>Compression waves:</h4><br>
This works best without gravity. In slinkey mode(s) with dynamic coloring(c) on, Stretch the slinkey<br>
out and wait until it stops moving. (or use (d) to quick damp) After it has stopped moving, drag the<br>
end of the slinkey toward and away from the other end compressing it.<br>
