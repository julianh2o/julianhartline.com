Born out of a passion for smarthome gadgets and inspired by the next generation of neopixel art, Flickerstrip is the first pattern-capable LED strip available to the consumer market. Flickerstrip aims to make the LED art accessable to everyone and no longer limited to programmers and tinkerers. With Flickerstrip, anyone can bring their creativity to light.
