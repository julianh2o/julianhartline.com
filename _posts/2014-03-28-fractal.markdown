Fractal is a relatively simple branch iterating fractal generation program. At each node, a number of branches are generated which continue to recursively generate each fractal.<br>
A number of premade fractals are available for viewing using the dropdown box at the top.<br>

<h2>Instructions</h2>Use the input boxes to change the fractal variables.<br>
Click and drag in the fractal area to move fractal around.<br>
Press return while in a box to redraw fractal<br>
This program starts by drawing a number of inital<br>
branches out of the center node. From each of these,<br>
more branches are made using the settings and the<br>
ending point of the previous branch. This continues for<br>
each iteration. To save, enter a name for the fractal and click save<br>
<br>
Iterations: How many times the fractal branches.<br>
Angle: Degrees between each branch<br>
Length: The fraction of the previous length that<br>
a segment has or how fast it shrinks.<br>
Initial length: The length of the first segment.<br>
Initial branches: The number of stems out of the<br>
central node.<br>
Branches: Number of branches off of each subsequent node.<br>
Offset: Degree offset of each branch.<br>
Rotation: Rotation in degrees of fractal. Include "d" at the<br>
end for continuous rotation.<br>
Delay: Animation speed.<br>
Display: Changes appearance (see below)<br>
The name box and the save button let you save a cool<br>
fractal with a name for others to see.<br>
The default fractal's values are in the save named "default"<br>
<br>
<h3>Animation</h3>To make a fractal animate a variable, you<br>
must supply it with a range and a step.<br>
Each field can be animated using this syntax in the parameter box: min~max;step.<br>
For example, to animate a growing fractal by animating the iterations,<br>
use 1~10;1 making the fractal loop from iteration 1 to iteration 10<br>
and the speed of one iteration per loop.<br>
<br>
<h3>Display</h3> Keywords<br>
"dot"-Places a dot on the end of the last branch<br>
"branch"- Places a dot on each  node (except the middle node)<br>
"dynamic"- Colors fractal based on iteration.<br>
"norm"- Adding norm to "dot" or "branch" draws the lines as well<br>
as the dots. (only useful with dot size greater than 1)<br>
To change the dot size, put the desired size in angle braces. [] or {}<br>
To draw dots of size 4 you might have "branch[4]" in the display parameter.<br>
Using angle braces[] makes the points square, using curly braces{} makes them circular.<br>
Fractal Color<br>
The format for color is: (red,green,blue). These<br>
values may be between 0 and 255.<br>
