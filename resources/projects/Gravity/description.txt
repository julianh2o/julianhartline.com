Written in C++ using SDL and OpenGL, Gravity is space combat game in which the player equips their craft with various parts and weaponry and pilots it in combat against other ships.

Gravity is in a quite juvenile stage, although the basic engine and equipment selection is there, the game currently has no attainable objective.
