Squirrel is a simple platform hopping game. Your character is a blue square and your objective is to reach a green goal box, located somewhere in the level.
Your character can climb some walls and jump off others.
Squirrel has a built in level editor and currently runs in developer mode all the time. Switching to edit mode is possible at any point.
